Sublime-Languages
=================

The existing language files seemed overly complex, and lacked comments and documentation. I'm hoping
to change that by starting from scratch. There are bound to be errors and missing pieces initially,
as I'm sure I only regularly use a small subset of each language's features. Over time though, I'll
hopefully have complete language definitions that are more comprehensible than existing definitions.

In general, I will be following the naming conventions in the Textmate [language grammars][1]
specification. This is sensible since it means existing themes will support the new language 
definitions. The specification is vague for some situations, and there I will use my best judgment.
